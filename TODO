Should be wrapped up in an installation package.

Should start automatically on login.
  But note that debugging output is useful when configuring.

Should restart on hotplug.
  This would help with crashes caused by static discharges.
  If it starts on reboot, needs to notice current user to find config
  file.

Should probably use uinput instead of XTest.

Might want to allow shuttle positions to allow repeated outputs at a
specified time interval.

A GUI for setting keystroke bindings would be nice.
